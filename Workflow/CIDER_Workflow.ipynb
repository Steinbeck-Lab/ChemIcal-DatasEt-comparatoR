    "## Chemical Space Visualization  \n",
    "Using ChemPlot the chemical space of the molecules can be visualized. Therefore, a chemical identifier is needed, but it does not matter if it is SMILES, InChI or InChIKey. ChemPlot will generate a fingerprint with a given fingerprint size (fp_bits) and radius (fp_radius). For the visualization the dimension of the chemical space needs to be reduced to two dimensions utilizing PCA, t-NSE or UMAP. Additionally, an interactive plot can be generated (will be opened in a new window).  \n",
    "Please remember that t-SNE and UMAP are probabilistic technique so they might give slightly different results every time they are run.  \n",
